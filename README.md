Goto is a project that follows the concept of Google golinks
([example](https://golinks.github.io/golinks/),
[example](https://www.golinks.io/)), with the primary difference being that we
do not dynamically serve these links. Further, we do not rely on domain
network. Instead, these links are statically generated and served like regular
webpages to the public Internet. The motivation is to provide myself a
golink-like utility that I can use myself.


## FAQs

1. Why not reuse some of the existing golink services?

Existing golink services require special domain network setup. I just want
something that can be served over the Internet and does not require running my
own service.

2. Why not using something like bit.ly?

I want to own the lifecycle of the links I provide. Further, I want easier
management of the links that I own.
